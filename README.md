# Hammad Ali - Professional Portfolio

A premium, high-converting, responsive developer portfolio built specifically for **Hammad Ali (Python & Odoo ERP Consultant)**.

Static site, no build step. `portfolio_data.yaml` holds the project and CV
content; `assets/app.js` fetches it at runtime, parses it with `js-yaml`, and
renders each page.

**Caveat on "no content is hardcoded":** three things are, deliberately.
The home-page hero copy and the `<noscript>` block live in `index.html` so
crawlers and no-JS clients see real content. Education and certifications are in
`experience.html`. And `app.js` hardcodes five project IDs for the "Selected
work" section on the experience page — rename one of those IDs in the YAML and
that section silently empties.

## ⚡ How to Run & Test Locally

Since the site loads `portfolio_data.yaml` dynamically via `fetch()`, modern browsers will block local file access due to CORS security policies when opening HTML files directly via `file://`.

To test the site locally, you must run it through a local development server:

### Option 1: Using Python (Built-in & recommended)
Open your terminal in the repository directory and run:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.

### Option 2: Using Node.js (npx)
Open your terminal in the repository directory and run:
```bash
npx serve
```
Then, open the printed local URL (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

## 🚀 Deployment & site URL

**Live URL:** <https://4858hammad.github.io/hammad-ali.github.io/>

The repo is `4858hammad/hammad-ali.github.io`. Because the repo name does not
match the account name, GitHub Pages serves this as a *project* page at the
doubled URL above — not at `hammad-ali.github.io`.

Verified 23 July 2026:

| URL | Status |
|---|---|
| `https://4858hammad.github.io/hammad-ali.github.io/` | ✅ 200 — live |
| `https://hammad-ali-odoo.github.io` | ❌ 404 — does not exist |
| `https://github.com/hammad-ali-odoo` | ❌ 404 — does not exist |
| `https://github.com/4858hammad` | ✅ 200 |

### To get a cleaner URL

- **Buy a domain** (~$12/yr). Add a `CNAME` file at the repo root containing just
  the bare domain, set it under Settings → Pages, and tick **Enforce HTTPS**.
- **Or rename the repo** to exactly `4858hammad.github.io` → serves at
  `https://4858hammad.github.io/`.

### ⚠️ If you change the URL, update it in all of these

The absolute site URL is written in these places. There is no build step, so
they do not update themselves:

1. `portfolio_data.yaml` → `site.url`
2. `assets/app.js` → the `SITE_BASE` constant near the top
3. Every `*.html` → `<link rel="canonical">` and `<meta property="og:url">`
4. Every `*.html` → the two `og:image` / `twitter:image` URLs
5. `index.html` → `"url"` and `"sameAs"` inside the JSON-LD block
6. `robots.txt` → the `Sitemap:` line
7. `sitemap.xml` → every `<loc>`

A one-line `sed` across the repo handles it:

```bash
grep -rl 'https://4858hammad.github.io/hammad-ali.github.io' . \
  --exclude-dir=.git \
  | xargs sed -i 's|https://4858hammad.github.io/hammad-ali.github.io|https://YOUR-NEW-URL|g'
```

## 📨 Contact Form

The contact form is **already configured** and live — it posts to Formspree form
`mzdwrpyp` via AJAX (`contact.html`, `action` attribute). No setup needed.

A honeypot field (`_gotcha`) is included; Formspree silently drops any submission
where it is filled, which stops most bot spam.

To point it at a different Formspree form, change the `action` attribute on
`<form id="contact-form">` in `contact.html`.

## ✍️ How to Update the Portfolio

You do **not** need to touch any HTML or JS files to update the content of your website. Simply open `portfolio_data.yaml` and make your edits:

### 1. To Add a New Project:
Add a new block under the `projects:` section. Follow this exact format:
```yaml
  - id: "unique-project-id"
    title: "Project Title"
    category: "odoo" # Can be: "odoo", "android", or "web"
    featured: true   # Set true to show on Home page featured grid
    year: 2024
    client: "Client Name"
    role: "Your Role (e.g. Lead Developer)"
    odoo_version: "Odoo 17" # Optional (only displayed for "odoo" category)
    image: "assets/images/project-screenshot.png" # Optional image path
    short_desc: "A one-sentence summary for project grid thumbnails"
    full_desc: "A complete description describing problem, context, and solutions."
    tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"] # Tags used for sub-navigation filtering
    modules: ["Module1", "Module2"] # Optional (only for Odoo projects list)
    tech_stack: ["Tech1", "Tech2"]
    highlights:
      - "Key achievement 1"
      - "Key achievement 2"
```

### 2. To Update Contact Details:
Edit the fields inside the `contact:` block:
```yaml
contact:
  email: "hammadali4858@gmail.com"
  phone: "+92 320 248 5828"
  linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/hammad-ali-62417224b"
  github: "https://github.com/hammad-ali-odoo"
  location: "Lahore, Pakistan"
  remote: true
```

### 3. To Update Metrics & Stats:
Edit the items under the `stats:` section:
```yaml
stats:
  - label: "Client projects delivered"
    value: "10+"
  - label: "Years experience"
    value: "3+"
```

### 4. To Update Resume Experience & Skills:
Edit the `experience:` or `skills:` sections. All content will dynamically structure itself across home, detail, listing, and contact grids.

## 🖼 Image Placeholders

If you do not specify an image or if the image file listed in `portfolio_data.yaml` goes missing, the system will **automatically generate** a styled CSS placeholder card:
- **Odoo projects** get a dark navy/blue theme placeholder with a `⚙` icon.
- **Android projects** get a green theme placeholder with a `📱` icon.
- **Web projects** get a purple theme placeholder with a `🌐` icon.

## ⚠️ Outstanding items

### Blocking (highest impact first)

1. **Project screenshots are missing.** `assets/images/` contains only
   `og-cover.png`. Every project falls back to a gradient placeholder, so
   visitors see a developer portfolio with no screenshots. See
   [`assets/images/README.md`](assets/images/README.md) for the exact filenames
   and shot list.
2. **Nine `# TO CONFIRM` markers in `portfolio_data.yaml`.** Several projects
   have employers or years that conflict with the employment dates in the same
   file. Search the YAML for `TO CONFIRM`.
3. **The GitHub link on the circulating CV PDF is a 404**
   (`github.com/hammad-ali-odoo`). Either rename the `4858hammad` account to
   `hammad-ali-odoo` (free, and GitHub auto-redirects old repo URLs) or reissue
   the PDF. `portfolio_data.yaml` currently points at `4858hammad`, which works.

### Not yet done

- Register the site in **Google Search Console** and **Bing Webmaster Tools**,
  and submit `sitemap.xml`. Nothing else reveals which queries you surface for.
- No analytics (Plausible, Umami or GA4).
- `js-yaml` still loads from cdnjs with no Subresource Integrity hash and no
  local fallback. The scripts are now `defer`red and a `<noscript>` block covers
  crawlers, but a blocked CDN still degrades the page. Self-hosting the ~40 KB
  library removes the dependency entirely.
- `project.html` serves all 15 projects from one URL. Titles, descriptions and
  canonicals are now set at runtime by `app.js`, which Google handles — but a
  build step emitting one static file per project would be strictly better and
  would fix the crawler-visibility problem at the same time.
- The nav logo and footer render `hammad.dev`, a domain that is not registered.
  It is derived in `app.js` from `site.name`; change it there if you want it to
  match the real URL.
- `assets/cv_source.html` is tracked but not linked from any page.
- `style.css` and `app.js` are unminified.

## 🧾 Changelog — 23 July 2026

- Rewrote the Showroom / PavoBixbox / CV Maker entries as the 2022 university
  projects they are, removing production-ERP language from student work
- Moved `showroom-erp` from the `odoo` category to `web` — `odoo.html` now shows
  exactly the 10 client projects
- Stats corrected: `10` client projects and `15` projects built (were `10+`/`19+`)
- Removed OWL, Odoo.sh, OAuth 2.0 and JSON-RPC from the skills list — no project
  in the file evidenced any of them
- Added per-page `<title>`, meta description, canonical, Open Graph and Twitter
  card tags; generated `og-cover.png`, `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`
- Added JSON-LD `Person` schema, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `404.html`

- One `<h1>` per page, carrying the target keyword
- Hardcoded real contact details in `contact.html` (was `email@example.com`)
- Added a `_gotcha` honeypot to the contact form
- `app.js`: fixed the `github.com/in/` link typo; escaped all YAML interpolated
  into `innerHTML`; guarded optional `modules` / `tags` fields; confined
  prev/next navigation to the current category; per-project runtime meta tags;
  a failed data fetch no longer wipes `document.body`
